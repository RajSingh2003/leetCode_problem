You are given an array arr[] of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.size() + 1





//Code

  class Solution {
    int missingNum(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        int n=arr.length+1;
        long total=(long)n*(n+1)/2;
        long sum =0;
        for(int num : arr ){
            sum=sum+num;
        }
        return (int) (total-sum); 
    }
}

3) Step-by-step trace — Example 1

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]

Initial:

arr.length = 4

n = arr.length + 1 = 5

Compute totalSum:

totalSum = (long)5 * 6 / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

Compute actualSum (loop):

start actualSum = 0

after num = 1 → actualSum = 1

after num = 2 → actualSum = 3

after num = 3 → actualSum = 6

after num = 5 → actualSum = 11

Return:

missing = totalSum - actualSum = 15 - 11 = 4

Output: 4
